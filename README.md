# Data-Mining
Contains programs related to small projects in Data Mining- modeling decision trees, implementing clustering on sample data, etc.
map_dtrees and reduce_dtrees builds a decision tree out of a training set of attributes and selects the attribute with the higest information gain; each attribute is iteratively chosen as the best test candidate along the path of the tree based on entropy values.
